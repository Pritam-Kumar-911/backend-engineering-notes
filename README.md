# Backend Engineering from First Principles

This repository documents my journey of learning backend engineering from first principles by understanding the fundamental concepts that power modern backend systems.

The focus is not on learning frameworks first, but on understanding the underlying architecture, communication models, and system behavior that make backend systems work.

# Why This Repository Exists

Modern frameworks make it possible to build backend systems without understanding what happens internally. While this improves productivity, it can limit deep engineering understanding.

This repository exists to ensure that I develop a strong mental model of backend systems by understanding:

- How requests travel from client to server
- How servers process, validate, and respond to requests
- How data is stored, retrieved, and managed
- How systems maintain performance, reliability, and security
- How scalable systems are designed and operated

The purpose is to understand backend systems at a foundational level, independent of specific tools or frameworks.

# First Principles Approach

Learning from first principles means breaking down complex systems into their most basic components and understanding each layer step by step.

Instead of relying on abstractions immediately, this approach focuses on understanding:

- How network communication works
- How protocols enable data exchange
- How servers handle concurrent users
- How backend layers interact internally
- How system components work together to form complete applications

This ensures that higher-level abstractions are understood clearly rather than treated as black boxes.

# What This Repository Covers

This repository serves as a structured knowledge base covering the core building blocks of backend systems, including:

## Communication and Protocol Layer
Understanding how clients and servers communicate over networks, how requests and responses are structured, and how data flows between systems.

## Request Processing and Application Layer
Understanding how servers receive requests, route them correctly, validate input, execute business logic, and generate responses.

## Data and Persistence Layer
Understanding how backend systems store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently and reliably.

## System Behavior and Reliability
Understanding how backend systems handle errors, maintain stability, manage configurations, and ensure reliable operation.

## Performance and Scalability Foundations
Understanding how systems improve performance, handle increasing load, manage concurrency, and scale efficiently.

## Observability and Operational Awareness
Understanding how systems are monitored, logged, and analyzed to maintain health and diagnose issues.

# Why Documenting This Matters

Documenting these concepts helps to:

- Reinforce deep understanding through structured explanation
- Build long-term retention of fundamental concepts
- Develop the ability to reason about system behavior
- Track learning progress over time
- Create a permanent personal reference
- Build strong engineering habits and discipline

This repository represents a long-term effort to master backend engineering fundamentals.

# Engineering Philosophy

Backend systems are built in layers of abstraction. While tools and frameworks simplify development, true engineering strength comes from understanding what happens underneath those abstractions.

Technologies change over time, but the underlying principles remain constant.

By focusing on fundamentals first, this approach ensures the ability to adapt to any technology, framework, or architecture.

# Long-Term Goal

The goal of this journey is to develop the knowledge and thinking required to design, build, and reason about reliable, scalable, and efficient backend systems from the ground up.

This repository serves as a continuously evolving knowledge base supporting that goal.
